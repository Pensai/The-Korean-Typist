# The-Korean-Typist
A small web application designed to help complete beginners become accustomed to typing in Korean. Aimed at building muscle memory from the ground up starting with the basics.

UPCOMING: Firebase implementation to facilitate profiles, statistics, and custom quizzes!

Potential upcoming features include:
- Ability to toggle romanization of characters to accompany the Hangul
- Profiles, including stats and other data of interest
- Time limits or other types of constraints
- Ability to import ones own set of characters, syllables, words or phrases to be quizzed on.
  
Anything else that comes to mind during development will be added to the above list.
